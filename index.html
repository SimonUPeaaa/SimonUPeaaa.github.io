                        <h2> The highlight of most children's eighth birthday is blowing out the candles on their cake.
                            However, for Joseph Deen, it was blowing the ink dry on his freshly-signed contract to be a professional game.
                            Joseph is the youngest-ever paid Fortnite player, after signing with Team 33 in December last year
                            The Californian esports team invited him to their headquarters to give him a $33,000 (£23,600) signing-on bonus, and high-speed computer system.
                            Fortnite is a third-person-style shooting and building game played online by hundreds of millions of gamers around the world.
                            "I felt amazing when I got offered the contract," Joseph told the BBC. "I've thought about being a professional gamer a lot, but no-one took me seriously until Team 33 came along."</h2>

                        <h2>Christians were among those targeted by IS when they seized the region in 2014, carrying out human rights abuses.
                            The Pope prayed among ruined churches in Mosul, the former IS stronghold, before meeting Christians in Qaraqosh.
                            He has arrived in Irbil to celebrate Mass at a stadium with up to 10,000 people expected despite Covid concerns.</h2>
                        There are fears the service could become a coronavirus super-spreader event.

                        <h2>
                            Wang Yi made the comments during his annual news conference on Sunday.
                            A number of nations, including the US, have used the term to describe Chinese treatment of Uighur people.
                            It comes amid growing evidence of abuses at "re-education camps" for Uighurs in Xinjiang province.
                            China has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families.
                            BBC investigations suggest that Uighurs are being used as forced labour and have revealed allegations of systematic rape and torture. China has banned BBC World News television over the corporation's coverage of the Uighur issue and coronavirus.
                            The UN says at least one million members of the Muslim minority are being held in the camps, which China says provide vocational training and are aimed at eradicating extremism.</h2>
